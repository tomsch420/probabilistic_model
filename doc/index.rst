Welcome to probabilistic_models's documentation!
================================================

This package contains an interface for any kind of probabilistic models.
The aim of this package is to provide a clean, unifying, well documented API to
probabilistic models. Just like sklearn does for classical machine learning models.

You can read more about the theory behind probabilistic models in these resources.
